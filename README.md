# Alert App

## Description

An alert app that allows users to send multiple SMS messages with one click. These messages will alert pre-chosen emergency contacts of the userâ€™s current situation. The app is primarily designed for young users, aged 10-21, including teens and college students, but can be used by anyone in need of immediate help.

## Features

- **Quick Alert Button:** Sends a default alert message along with the user's current location to pre-chosen emergency contacts.
- **Custom Alert Button:** Enables users to send a personalized message along with their location to selected contacts.
- **Status Update Option:** Allows the user to provide additional details about the ongoing situation via a drop-down menu, which triggers an update SMS to the emergency contacts.
- **End Alert Button:** Notifies the app and emergency contacts that the situation has been resolved.

## Why This App?

## Target Audience

## Usage

The app is designed to be easily accessible and usable whenever the user senses danger. The alert button should be readily accessible upon opening the app.
